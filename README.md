# LineFollowingBot

The code in this file was developed as part of a class where I built a line following robot. I designed and constructed the circuit board and attached the motors for this machine. The robot followed black electrical tape using optical sensors and stops briefly when it detects a magnetic field. An LED turns on or blinks depending on the direction of the magnetic field.

This repository contains the C code that this robot used to navigate the obstacle course containing the obstacles mentioned previously.
